# Login-signup
Basic Login/Signup Page

This is a project I am using as practive to use basic java functions and also try and use a little more advanced css. 

Bugs that still need to be fixed... 
1. the signup button is not acting correct and keeping the css style when clicked.
2. the nav bar moved slightly when shifting between Login and Signup
3. Login and sign up in the content box is not working for some reason.
